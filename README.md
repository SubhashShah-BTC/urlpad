# UrlPad

Since long, I was looking for something that can help listing URLs. Something like note taking application.

### Tools:

- git clone `git@github.com:subhash-shah/urlpad.git`
- cd urlpad
- rake db:setup
- bundle exec puma
- navigate to `http://localhost:9292`

### Server:
- `http://urlpad.herokuapp.com/`
